Hey nerds it's your favorite (or not so favorite) youtube maker guy person, this is my first time making my own repository so bear with me if it's rough :-;

The printable files have conveniently been sliced in half for those of you (myself included) with a printer that isn't big enough to print the full files.
If you're rich and half a big boy printer than go ahead and print the full sized models (I didn't shrink them I just mean use the not-cut-in-half models)
Otherwise print the left and right and glue them together with whatever super glue you have lying around, be careful not to get the glue anywhere it shouldn't
be getting.

By the way the stuff you need is listed here:
3d printed parts

(Standoffs for raising the plate in the case; this is required do not ignore these parts!)
You will need switches, I have no idea what switches I have all I know is that they are red dragon switches and linear (smooth not clicky)
You will need plate mount stabilizers, 3 shorter ones and 1 long one for the space bar
You will need wires and copper wire, I am using the plusivo 16 awg hook up wire kit (have no idea what the link is my dad bought it)
